    - Added a load of new phrases that were previously hard-coded in
      Net::Appliance::Session
    - Added a 'Cisco' entry to the hierachy to carry these
    - Added a 'CATOS' dictionary, but it's untested and pretty basic
    - Hacked around a bug in Data::Phrasebook whereby a call to dicts() or
      keywords() would fail unless a fetch() had already been done. Now you
      can call keywords() immediately after instantiation
    - Updated tests to cope with changes to built-in dicts
    - Added more info to the POD about custom phrasebooks
